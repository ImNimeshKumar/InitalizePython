India wouldn't mind this.
The scorecard shows they've crawled at 2.42 rpo, but they've clearly been the more dominant party on display here.
If you take the brief Starc spell, towards the end of the day with the second new ball, out of the equation,
there was nothing really for the Aussies to show in the final session. The edges didn't carry, the catches didn't stick.
So Agarwal laid the platform well, Pujara toiled it out and Kohli was his usual sublime self.
The track looked slow at the start, two-paced, but then with the sun beating down, seems to have quickened up significantly.
It took Starc three spells to find his mojo, Lyon too couldn't do a Perth or an Adelaide, and Cummins was the pick with his hard lengths and effort deliveries.
But Australia could draw hope from the fact that the ball is still new and from India's history with lower-order collapses.
Right then, do join us tomorrow for what promises to be another attritional day of Test cricket and until we see you then, ta ta!!
